Program the WASD keys to change aspects of a form in the center of the canvas... e.g. pressing W continuously rounds the edge of a square until it's a circle, while pressing A & D make the shape smaller and larger, and S changes the color. The range of values for each of the 4 variables designate a single corresponding sound, so interactivity without direct interaction.

Set each key to generate a different animation (shape/movement) somewhere on screen when pressed, and play a song underneath to let the keyboard become a playground for matching the music with visuals. Make different songs possible at the start.

Expand on my animation where the screen fills with an ellipse of a random size & color by limiting where it generates a new ellipse to a small distance from the cursor, so it becomes a paintbrush of random color. Clicking the mouse changes what shape you're spawning at random size.
